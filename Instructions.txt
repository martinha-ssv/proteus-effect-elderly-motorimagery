Virtual reality setup

Name: Setup VR OldYoung Beaudoin et al 2020
Softwares: Unity (2017.1.1f1) + Autodesk 3ds Max

Instructions:

1: Selecting an experimental condition
- Assets > Scenes : old (elderly avatar embodiment condition), young (young avatar embodiment condition)

2: Updating the computer path for saving motor imagery times 
- In Hierarchy: Select the object "Text" (timer > Canvas > Text)
- In Inspector: Update the saving path (Timer 1 (Script) > Save Path)

3: Running the motor imagery task (computer keyboards)
- 1 to 5 (above the letters): appearance of a chair in the virtual corridor (5 distances)
- Space key: start and stop time recording
- Enter key: save time in the data file Data.txt (saved following the path entered in step 2).
